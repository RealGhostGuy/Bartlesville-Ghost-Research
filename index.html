    <h2><center>Who we are!</center></h2>
    <p><center><strong>Hi, I am Jason Alexander (AKA, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheRealGhostGuyJason">The Ghost Guy</a>), and I like to attempt to debunk things, such as Ouija boards, orbs, and so much more!  People sometime say I am a little extreme with some of the experiments I want to take on, but I believe, and have always said, if you are too scared to test out the theory, then you do not belong in this field, and should not call yourself a paranormal investigator!</strong></center></p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BartlesvilleGhosts">Bartlesville Ghost Research Team</a> was founded on the basis of testing theories, because we basically got tired of the run of the mill teams, scaring people into thinking they had a haunting, when it was nothing more than an icemaker!  Most things in ghost hunting can be explained away, but there are the things that mystify us all, and cannot be explained.  There are also tools that people use that they claim are more dangerous than the other peices we use, like Ouija boards for isntance, what makes them more dangerous than a voice recorder?  That is what we are here to find out!</strong> </p>
